    # Render points to the project root by default. 
    # For Laravel, it's better to set the root as 'public' in the dashboard or use a redirect.
    # However, Render's native PHP environment often handles 'public/' if it's a Laravel app.
    # We can also add a 'startCommand' if needed, but for PHP it uses Apache by default.
